# Shared setup for the tests. pytest finds this file automatically
# and passes the fixtures below to any test that names them as a parameter.
#
# The tests use the same MySQL database as the app (set in .env).
# Every actor a test adds uses TEST_LAST_NAME, and the test puts its
# actor_id in the created_actor_ids list. Those rows are deleted after
# the test, so the sakila data is left unchanged.
